# Twitter Showcase App

## Description

This is my Twitter Showcase App. It works with the Twitter API in order to provide two main functions that displayed on separate pages. The Searcg Page allows you to search for tweets with keywords or users. On the Favorite Accounts page you will see my top five Twitter accounts and you can press a button to randomly display a few of their tweets. The process of creating this application was super fun and although it seemed a little daunting at the start, breaking the project down into smaller parts made it more manageable. This was the first time that I got to work with two different frameworks in one project. Combining React and Flask was tricky but having done it once, it will be definitely be easier going forward.

It's pretty cool how much I've learned since starting this project. Looking back now, I see that I've made some big jumps in terms of my front and back end development knowledge. To touch on a couple of things, I learned about custom CSS properties, conditional rendering in React, HTTP requests with Axios, connecting Front and back end frameworks and much more. I know that if you're looking for tweets you can just go on Twitter but I think this project is great because it not only shows what I can do as a programmer but also shares a little bit about who I am as a person.

## Usage

As mentioned above, the app has two main functions. Click on the search page or the favorite accounts page in the nav-bar to access them.

The search page allows you to search for tweets either by the content or by users. If you're searching by content you can just type in anything you like and then click the magnifying glass. For example if I type in "Pokemon" then it will pull up tweets from multiple authors including that key word. If you're searching by user, you must add the @ symbol before the username of the account. For example if I type in "@pokemon" it will pull up tweets from only that one twitter account. 

The Favorite Accounts page will display 5 Twitter accounts that will provide some insight on who I am and the things that I'm interested in. Click on the "Display Random Tweet" button to view tweets from these accounts. Each account will come with a small summary although it's less of a description of the twitter page and more about what it means to me.
